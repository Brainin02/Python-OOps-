        "\n",
        "ans- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which are instances of classes. It organizes code into reusable structures that represent real-world entities, making it easier to develop, maintain, and scale software.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP+\n",
        "\n",
        "ans. A class in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the attributes (data) and methods (functions) that the objects created from the class will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP+\n",
        "\n",
        "ans. An object is an instance of a class in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It represents a real-world entity and has its own state (attributes) and behavior (methods).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation+\n",
        "\n",
        "ans. Difference Between Abstraction and Encapsulation\n",
        "\n",
        "a)Abstraction\n",
        "\n",
        "Definition: Hiding implementation details and showing only necessary functionality.\n",
        "\n",
        "Purpose:\tFocuses on hiding complexity to simplify interaction with the system.\n",
        "\n",
        "How?\tAchieved using abstract classes, interfaces.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example\t:A car’s interface (steering, pedals) hides the internal working of the engine.\n",
        "\n",
        "Scope\t:Deals with what an object does (design-level concept).\n",
        "\n",
        "b)Encapsulation:\n",
        "\n",
        "Definition.\tWrapping data and methods into a single unit to protect them.\n",
        "\n",
        "Purpose\t.\tFocuses on data protection and preventing unauthorized access.\n",
        "\n",
        "How?\t.\tAchieved using access modifiers (private, protected, public).\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Scope\t:\tDeals with how data is restricted (implementation-level concept).\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  What are dunder methods in Python+\n",
        "\n",
        "ans. Dunder (short for double underscore) methods, also known as magic methods or special methods, are built-in methods in Python that have double underscores (__) at the beginning and end of their names. These methods define how objects of a class behave with Python’s built-in functions and operators.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.  Explain the concept of inheritance in OOPH\n",
        "\n",
        "ans. Inheritance is a fundamental concept in OOP that allows a class (child/subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent/superclass). This promotes code reusability and enables the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP+\n",
        "\n",
        "ans. Polymorphism means \"many forms\" and allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables one interface to be used for different data types, promoting flexibility and reusability in code.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. H How is encapsulation achieved in Python+\n",
        "\n",
        "ans. Encapsulation is a fundamental OOP concept that restricts direct access to data and bundles attributes and methods into a single unit (class) to protect it from unintended modifications.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, encapsulation is achieved using access modifiers:\n",
        "\n",
        "a)Public (public_var) – Accessible from anywhere.\n",
        "\n",
        "b)Protected (_protected_var) – Should not be accessed outside the class\n",
        "(by convention, not enforced).\n",
        "\n",
        "c)Private (__private_var) – Cannot be accessed directly outside the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python+\n",
        "\n",
        "ans. A constructor is a special method in a class that automatically gets called when an object is created. In Python, the constructor method is __init__(). It is used to initialize attributes of the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python+\n",
        "\n",
        "ans. Python provides two special types of methods:\n",
        "\n",
        "Class Methods (@classmethod) – Operate on the class itself rather than instances.\n",
        "\n",
        "Static Methods (@staticmethod) – Independent of the class and instance, used for utility functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python+\n",
        "\n",
        "ans. Method Overloading allows a class to define multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. It enables a function to handle different types or numbers of arguments.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python does not support true method overloading like Java or C++, but we can achieve similar functionality using:\n",
        "\n",
        "Default arguments\n",

        "12. What is method overriding in OOP+\n",
        "\n",
        "ans. Method Overriding is a feature in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) where a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Points:\n",
        "\n",
        "The method name and parameters must be the same in both parent and child classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is used to customize behavior in the subclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "The overridden method in the child class replaces the parent class method when called on a child object.\n",
        "\n",
        "We can still access the parent class method using super().\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python+\n",
        "\n",
        "ans. What is a Property Decorator (@property) in Python?\n",
        "The @property decorator in Python is used to define getter methods for class attributes, allowing them to be accessed like regular attributes while still enforcing encapsulation.\n",
        "\n",
        " Key Benefits:\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation: Controls access to private attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Read-Only Properties: Prevents direct modification of sensitive attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Computed Properties: Returns a value dynamically instead of storing it.\n",
        "\n",
        "Cleaner Syntax: Allows method access without parentheses (()).\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP+\n",
        "\n",
        "ans. Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. This provides flexibility, extensibility, and maintainability in software design.\n",

        "\n",
        "ans. What is an Abstract Class in Python?\n",
        "An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated and serves as a blueprint for other classes. It defines abstract methods that must be implemented by subclasses.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Points:\n",
        "\n",
        " Defined using the ABC (Abstract Base Class) module.\n",
        "\n",
        " Contains at least one abstract method (declared but not implemented).\n",
        "\n",
        " Cannot be instantiated (i.e., you can't create objects from it).\n",

        "\n",
        "Code Reusability (Inheritance)\n",
        "\n",
        "OOP allows you to reuse existing code instead of writing it from scratch.\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance enables a new class (child) to inherit properties and methods from an existing class (parent).\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation (Data Security)\n",
        "\n",
        " Encapsulation hides the internal details of an object and exposes only the necessary parts.\n",
        "\n",
        " Prevents direct access to sensitive data, reducing bugs and security risks.\n",
        "\n",
        " Code Maintainability & Scalability\n",

        "\n",
        " ans. __str__ vs __repr__ Methods in Python\n",
        "In Python, __str__ and __repr__ are dunder (double underscore) methods that define how objects are represented as strings. These methods help improve readability and debugging by customizing how objects appear when printed or inspected.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python+\n",
        "\n",
        "ans. The super() function is used in object-oriented programming (OOP) to call a method from a parent class in a child class. It allows you to avoid directly referring to the parent class, making your code more maintainable and flexible.\n",
